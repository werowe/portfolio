# Tilly Norwood, the First AI Actor, Will Create New Actors and Bring Back Old Ones


“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”

Ingrid Bergman is back, breaking hearts and turning heads again. But there’s a new girl on the horizon: Tilly Norwood. How far will she go? Let’s see.

Actors in Hollywood are fuming that AI actors might replace them. But they are howling into the wind, and no one can hear them. The wind will either carry them aloft, letting them reach new heights, or scatter them like dust, where they will be forgotten. Which way would you go?

Fret not, existing actors—and for those who aspire to be actors—there is enormous upside.

Yes, they are upset that Tilly was created without their consent. But that is a problem easily fixed. License thyself. You’ll never grow old. You’ll never die. The truly famous will enrich their heirs for generations to come.

Consider what AI-generated images and sound can do:

- 💎 Amateurs who act in local theaters, and those on Broadway and Piccadilly Circus who want to be in series and films, can license their image to AI production companies. AI algorithms and professional casting agents can sort through those and select people for films, commercials, series, and more. It would democratize the whole hiring process. AI will uncover new talent. AI already picks employees for jobs; now it can pick actors for acting roles and bring them to life.

- 💎 The descendants of deceased actors can bring their parents, grandparents, and others back to life. We could see Humphrey Bogart make new movies, John Wayne get back in the saddle, and Sophia Loren return to the screen. “Here’s looking at you, kid—again.”

- 💎 Older actors can appear as their younger selves on screen. Clint Eastwood can thrill us again when he says, “make my day.” AI technology has already been used to remove wrinkles and blemishes from Robert De Niro and others. So how can they complain about that?

- 💎 The Beatles could reunite. We could have new music written by McCartney and Lennon, performed by The Beatles using their voices from the 1960s.

- 💎 AI can write movies and series, too. All it needs to do is read all of Neil Simon, Tom Stoppard, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austen—and then write like they do.

AI has touched every aspect of life: work, war, love, music, and now film. It’s as if the lightbulb has replaced the candle. We may long for the warmth of its flickering glow, but now we bask in the steady brilliance of the AI-powered lightbulb, whose colors and brightness change automatically as the day fades into night.
