# How to Hire a Data Scientist, Researcher, or Machine Learning Engineer

Need to staff an AI/ML project? First, you should understand the required skills, as much has changed in recent years.

Regular programming is already highly segmented—expertise in one specialty doesn’t translate to another due to the steep learning curve.

AI disrupts this further: it’s not just about coding. You need a strong background in math—especially linear algebra, calculus, and statistics. This is typically learned in university. Programming can be learned on the job.

## Skills for Regular Programmers

Years ago, hiring programmers was simpler. At Andersen Consulting, we took any university graduate and trained them in COBOL. Today, programming is divided into dozens of specialties, each with its own frameworks and APIs—knowledge of one does not mean you have knowledge in another.

Programmers are generally divided into:
- Front-end
- Back-end/Middleware
- AI Programmer or ML Engineer
- SQL/Data Warehouse, Chart Developers
- Big Data/NoSQL Admins

## Skills for AI Programmers

AI programmers are divided into:
- Data Scientist
- AI Researcher
- Machine Learning Engineer

AI is further divided into these fields of expertise:
- Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Time Series Analysis
- Predictive Models
- Bayesian Inference

There is an alphabet soup of tools to master:
- scikit-learn, PyTorch, Flux, R, TensorFlow, SciPy, Matlab, WolframAlpha

For LLMs & RAG systems:
- LangChain, Vector Databases, RAG, Embedding Models

## The Big Differences Between AI Skills

Each of these is unique:

- **AI Researcher:** Focuses on mathematical theory, reading/writing academic papers, and new algorithm discovery; often holds a PhD.
- **Data Scientist:** Deep understanding of AI algorithms and APIs, model tuning and evaluation, strong math and data visualization skills.
- **Machine Learning Engineer (MLOps):** Deploys code to production using orchestration tools, Docker, and cloud platforms—making AI robust and scalable.
