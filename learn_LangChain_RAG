# Want to Learn LangChain and RAG? OpenAI Is Too Expensive — So What Else Can You Use?

When learning LLM programming, **cost and model access matter**. For instance, you can use GPT‑5 through Perplexity, but it has rate limits. With OpenAI, GPT‑5 offers no fixed monthly price—API costs are usage‑based and aimed at enterprise budgets.

OpenAI currently has no true low‑cost or free plan. The pay‑as‑you‑go API is priced for professionals. **GPT-5 costs $1.50 per 1 million input tokens and $10.00 per 1 million output tokens.**

A *token* is a small piece of text—such as a word, part of a word, or a punctuation mark—that an AI model uses to understand and generate language. **Input tokens** are what you send to the model (your prompt), and **output tokens** are what the model sends back as its response.

If you’re learning AI development, there are **more affordable alternatives**:

- **Open‑source or hybrid providers:**  
  Groq, Together AI, and OpenRouter host top models like Llama 3, Mixtral, and DeepSeek at a fraction of the cost.

- **Other platforms with free/low-tier access:**  
  Google AI Studio, Hugging Face, and DeepSeek API also offer free or low-cost options. DeepSeek is about ten times less expensive than OpenAI (the open model is for self-hosting, but DeepSeek’s API runs it in their cloud).

- **Local inference:**  
  [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is a downloadable model runner. It can run Llama 3, Gemma, Mistral, and Phi 3 models locally on your device and works with LangChain and other tools.

With **Perplexity Pro** ($20/month), you can access open models such as **Mistral‑7B**, **Code Llama‑34B**, and **Llama‑70B**.

> However, the Sonar and Sonar Pro APIs don’t yet work natively with LangChain’s chat interfaces.

**Vector databases:**  
- **Chroma** and **Pinecone**: both offer free plans (Pinecone gives 5 GB for free).
- **Faiss** (Facebook AI Similarity Search): fully free and open-source, download and run it yourself.
- Chroma and Faiss are self-hosted downloads, while Pinecone is a managed cloud service.
