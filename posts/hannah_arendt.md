# What Did America's Most Famous Female Philosopher Think of AI and the Future of Work?

Even people who have never read philosophy have probably heard of Hannah Arendt.

This dark-haired, chain-smoking German-Jewish woman with sad eyes and a pensive look was America's most famous political philosopher. Books alone did not bring her fame. Her early life reads like a spy novel.

Hannah Arendt was born in Hannover, Germany, in 1906. She fell out with the Nazis, and they jailed her not once, but twice. And she escaped from prison not once, but twice.

Then she and her husband fled to America.There she wrote books about totalitarian regimes and what it was like to be a stateless person. As a refugee, she lived without any citizenship at all for 18 years, until she became a US citizen.

In 1961, she fell out with the Jewish community for a while when she was dispatched by The New Yorker magazine to Jerusalem to write about the trial of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann. He oversaw the deportation of Jews from German-occupied countries. He had been snatched from Argentina by Israeli spies, where he was living under a different name. In her article she basically did not write what the world expected. 
 
Regarding AI and the rapidly emerging robot workforce, Hannah Arendt argued that advanced automation can hollow out meaningful work and turn people into cogs in large technical systems. This undermines the basis for genuine political life and increases the risk of mass, depoliticized societies that are vulnerable to authoritarianism and crisis.

Contemporary Arendt scholars now explicitly apply her analysis to AI, warning that large-scale automation of labor threatens dignity, citizenship, and social stability unless institutions are redesigned. 

Hannah saw this not in terms of robots taking jobs, but as a deeper crisis of meaning and belonging that undermines the conditions for freedom.

Arendt argued that modern society defines people primarily through their labor, yet automation reduces the need for human labor and threatens to leave a “labor society which lacks enough laboring to keep it contented.”

Stated another way, particularly in America, people's identity is tied to their work. People will introduce themselves as "I am a doctor" or "I am an accountant." But when people are severed from their work, what are they?

They are rootless people without a sense of identity or self-worth. They will spend the day with their noses buried in their phones and gravitate to their algorithm-driven echo chambers. They read fake news and then lose the ability to distinguish fiction from fact. Many people never had this ability for critical thinking at all, because they are not educated in rhetoric.

Clever politicians will prey on their resentment and promise them new work in a new economy. But unlike the post World War I Germany of Hannah's youth, there will be no work to return to as AI and robots take that away.
