#Who was the First Writer to Explain What Will Happen When AI Takes All the Jobs?

```
When the Industrial Age started in England, machines replaced many jobs.
But who was the first writer to contemplate what might happen when AI and robots replace all jobs?

YouTube is filled with interviews with philosophers giving their opinions. They worry there will be civil unrest. Remember that unemployed, starving people in America will carry guns.

But who was the first writer to put pen to paper and write it all down? Kurt Vonnegut.

Vonnegut’s first novel, Player Piano (1952), imagines an America where machines and early computers have taken over most work. Factory jobs, machinists, operators, clerks—whole categories of workers are replaced by automated systems run by a thin elite of engineers and managers.

The unemployed and their families are pushed across the river into a ghetto called Homestead. These people are not starving, because the state gives them funds for basic housing, food, clothing, healthcare, and school through taxes on the machine economy. See, Vonnegut said the tech companies would pay for the people they displace. Some people say that today. 

But make-work jobs in the “Reeks and Wrecks” corps obviously are pointless. The real poverty is psychological. For many people, work defines the man. So who is a man when there is no work?

There was no ChatGPT then. Yet Vonnegut mentions the vacuum tube. Those were logic gates before the silicon CPU.

One character observes that if you graph the number of workers against the number of vacuum tubes in use, human hours fall as the tubes rise. That is ominous as that curve threatens to become exponential. 

All of this grows out of the Third World War, where engineers learned to run factories with minimal labor and punch-card planning while most people fought overseas.

After the war, that emergency system became the permanent model: an automated, technocratic economy that sidelines most workers.

War is the reason many of us Americans know who Kurt Vonnegut is. He was an American prisoner of war during the World War II bombing of Dresden. Vonnegut wrote about the resulting firestorm and the horrors of war in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five.

This income inequality (sound familiar?) and poverty of the soul begins to weigh heavily on the main character, Paul. He is the manager of the largest factory in the land at Ilium. People only go across the river to Homestead when they want a prostitute, gambling, or alcohol. But Paul goes there because he has other ideas of how to help those people whose have been cast adrift by automation.
