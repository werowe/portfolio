# When will we Know we Have Reached AGI? 

Alan Turing created the Turing Test, which says we will have built a machine that can really think when we cannot tell the difference between what it says or writes and what a human says or writes.

But that is incomplete, because we have already reached that point, and we know that LLMs are not the same thing as intelligence. I propose a new milestone: we will have created actual intelligence when AI creates something genuinely new.

We can illustrate this by looking at writing, art, and music.

# AI and Bach
We have seen that AI can write operas and classical music because it has listened to Mozart, Handel, Bach, and The Beatles. But could it write something truly new? Could it invent something as different as rap, country, the blues, or rock and roll?

# Writing
Could AI invent a new writing style? Writing basically has two broad traditions: realist and imaginative. The creation of the second form was perhaps the largest major shift in writing.

Dickens and Austen were what we call realists: psychologically complex but still grounded in realism. Then Faulkner and Joyce developed Stream of Consciousness, which means writing what people are thinking, going inside the mind. The result is a jumble of words, as our thoughts come tumbling out in no particular order.

Proust wrote like a dream. Kafka and David Foster Wallace were like no one else. Thomas Pynchon and Virginia Woolf broke new ground. Cormac McCarthy turned violence into art.

Prose itself has many variations: memoir, journalism, academic, and history.

Then there poems, plays, screenplays, advertising, and propaganda.

# Painting
What might come after Picasso? After the realism of masters like Da Vinci came Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism, and Cubism. AI could simply splatter paint against a wall and call that art, but Jackson Pollock already did that.

# Music
What we call Western music uses scales built on the octave. AI could change that and make, say, a scale of 12 keys, but other composers have already tried. None of that stuck, at least in the West. Probably because the octave is logical. This is because when we go up a chord we double the frequency in sound.

But could AI do what Bach did and invent a new form, like the fugue or canon? What about a new kind of chord progression or a new key or mode?

# Art Defined
What all these things have in common is that they are real works that sprang from genuine innovation—like mathematics. Can AI propose Fermat’s Next Theorem?

# AGI
When will we know we have reached Artificial General Intelligence. Geoffrey Hinton suggests that is when machines are "smarter" than we are. But that's not correct. Because computers are already smarter, if we define smart as being fast or having a large memory or being best at chess. AGI must be defined as the ability to innovate.
